Fedora 19 ARM for Allwinner A10, A10s, A13 and A20 devices README
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Quickstart guide
----------------

1) Insert an sdcard, note any data on the card will be destroyed!
2) Make sure the card is not mounted, run "mount" and if the card shows
   up in the output umount its partitions
3) Write the img file to the card, ie as root do:
   xzcat Fedora-19-a10-armhfp-r2.img.xz > /dev/mmcblk0
   sync
4) The card is not yet ready for use! Since the A10 u-boot is board
   specific, the image comes without any uboot install, follow the next
   steps to install the right u-boot for your board
5) Remove the card, and re-insert it. The uboot partition should get
   automatically mounted, if not mount it manually,
6) As root (or through sudo) run: <uboot-part-mount>/select-board.sh, ie:
   sudo /run/media/hans/uboot/select-board.sh

   If you've dialog installed the select-board.sh script will prompt for
   your board. If you don't have dialog installed, it will print the list
   of supported boards. Lookup your board and re-run the script with the
   shortname for your board as argument, ie:
   sudo sh /run/media/hans/uboot/select-board.sh mk802
7) umount the uboot and rootfs partitions, ie:
   umount /run/media/hans/uboot
   umount /run/media/hans/rootfs
8) Your sdcard is now ready for use
9) *Before* powering up your A10 device connect it to an hdmi or dvi monitor
10) When first booting from the sdcard inserted Fedora will automatically
   reboot once, this is part of the process to resize the root partition to
   fill the entire sdcard and is normal behavior.
11) After the automatic reboot Fedora will start with the initial-setup wizard:
   11a) Configure networking, note:
        * If you've an A10 board with wired ethernet and you want to use dhcp
          you don't need to do anything.
        * If you've an A20 board, your ethernet may have a random mac-address,
          so if you want to configure a static ip-address and want it to stick
          across reboots, go to the ethernet-tab, select the mac-address field
          and delete its contents, so that the static ip address you're
          configuring does not get tied to the random mac-address.
   11b) Setup the time zone
   11c) Set a root password
   11d) Create a user
12) Log in as the just created user
13) Enjoy Fedora on your A10 device

Configuring the display output
------------------------------

Multiple video outputs at the same time are not supported. By default
hdmi output with EDID is used for all devices, except for tablets/netbooks
where the default output is the lcd.

The default hdmi output with EDID will get the native resolution of your
TV / monitor and use that. Note that in order for this to work your TV /
monitor must be connected *and turned on*, before booting your device.

The output resolution can be configured with the disp.screen0_output_mode
kernel cmdline value, which can be found in the extrargs part of uEnv.txt in
the uboot partition. The default uEnv.txt contains the following value:
disp.screen0_output_mode=EDID:1280x720p60

This means try to use EDID and if no valid EDID info is found fallback to
1280x720p60.

The used output can be changed by adding disp.screen0_output_type=X to the
extraargs in uEnv.txt. With X being one of: 0:none; 1:lcd; 2:tv; 3:hdmi; 4:vga

Some per display type notes:
-lcd outputs: Hardcoded to the native mode, disp.screen0_output_mode is ignored
-tv: For the cvbs output disp.screen0_output_mode must be set to one of the
 following: pal, pal-svideo, ntsc, ntsc-svideo, pal-m, pal-m-svideo, pal-nc,
 pal-nc-svideo. Note the -svideo variants should only be used on boards with
 an svideo connector, for composite out use the regular variants, ie:
 disp.screen0_output_type=2 disp.screen0_output_mode=pal
-hdmi: To override the EDID detected mode, drop the "EDID:" from the
 disp.screen0_output_mode value and set it to the desired mode, ie:
 disp.screen0_output_type=3 disp.screen0_output_mode=1360x768p60
-vga: Does not support EDID, "EDID:" must be removed from the
 disp.screen0_output_mode value otherwise it will be ignored. interlaced 
 progressive and refreshrate settings specified are ignored, each resolution
 has hardcoded values for these. Example usage:
 disp.screen0_output_type=4 disp.screen0_output_mode=1024x768


How to power your allwinner device
----------------------------------

For reliable operation it is important that your allwinner device is properly
powered. Some users try to power their allwinner development boards through
the power pin on the serial port / uart connector. This is a very bad idea!
and will almost always result in unreliable operation. Instaed always power
your allwinner device over the barrel connector intended for that using,
using a quality, reliable power supply.


USB controller caveats
----------------------

The OTG USB controller in host mode only supports a limited number of
devices, plugging in a hub + mouse + keyboard typically will make either
the mouse or keyboard not work. This is a hardware limitation which we
will likely not be able to work around.

On tv-sticks and top-set boxes, simply avoid the otg connector, instead
use a hub in a regular host usb connector. Note on the mini-x the otg / host
marking is not always correct. If things don't work try using the OTG
connector instead!

On tablets and the gooseberry unfortunately only the otg connector is
available. One solution there is using a single usb-device which is
both a keyboard and a mouse at the same time. IE the receiver for logitech
wireless desktop sets.


Known Issues
------------
* The broadcom sdio wifi found in the Auxtek T004 hdmi-stick and on the
  Cubietruck is not supported


Supported hardware components / features:
-----------------------------------------

Fedora 19 ARM for Allwinner A10 supports the following components:
* CPU + PMU + RAM
* Serial ports
* MMC cards
* Internal NAND storage
* Framebuffer on lcd / vga / hdmi / composite video
* Sound both analog out and over hdmi
* OTG USB controller
* Both standard USB host controllers
* Wifi
* Wired Ethernet
* SATA
* IR (untested at this time)
* SPI (as module, not supported on A20)
* "tablet" keys on olinuxino boards
* 7 and 10 inch lcd displays on olinuxino boards (requires selecting the
  right config in select-board.sh


Unsupported hardware components:
--------------------------------

The following components require various proprietary blobs to be used, and
as such are not supported in the Fedora images. The kernel drivers for them
are present (usually as modules), so if you add the necessary blobs you might
get these to work:
* Mali 400 GPU
* Cedar hardware video & audio decoding and encoding engine
* G2D 2d engine

Note that the drivers for these need some memory to be reserved at boot, and
since they are not supported by default in the Fedora images, this memory
reservation has been disabled. To reserve the memory edit /boot/uEnv.txt and
remove the kernel cmdline options which disable the memory reservation.


Differences from stock Fedora
-----------------------------
* Since the A10 is not a very powerful soc some services which are enabled by
  default on Fedora are disabled in the image, see build-image.sh for a list.
* No plymouth: we log to a serial console for debugging so no pretty splash.
  Also we don't use an initrd, so removing the console=ttyS0,115200 from
  the extraargs in uEnv.txt will give plymouth, but so late it hardly matters.


Rebuilding the Fedora 19 ARM for Allwinner A10 disk image
---------------------------------------------------------

Building the Fedora 19 ARM for Allwinner A10 disk image consists of 2 steps
1) Building a uboot.tar.gz and rootfs.tar.gz "overlays", this is done
   bu the build-boot-root-sh script
2) Combining uboot.tar.gz and rootfs.tar.gz with an official Fedora 19 arm img,
   this combining is done by the build-image.sh script
   The a10 image you downloaded is based on Fedora-XFCE-armhfp-19-1-sda.raw

These scripts are hosted here:
https://github.com/jwrdegoede/sunxi-fedora-scripts.git

A copy of the exact versions of these scripts used to build this Fedora A10
image can be found in the scripts directory of the uboot partition, the
kernel config used during the build can be found here too.

If you want to exactly reproduce this image it is important to use the
scripts from the scripts dir of the uboot partition, as the scripts contain
GIT tags used during the build to checkout the exact versions to build.

The pre-conditions these scripts expect to be met, and the exact usage of
them is documented in comments in the top of each script.
