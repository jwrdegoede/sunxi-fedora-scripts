 http://xre2k.bugs3.com/repos/arm/source_sun4i/
-fix emac phy setup when cable gets inserted after boot (sun7i improvements)
 -drop link wait ?
 -the sun7i code dump has many interesting improvements to the emac code, also
  see emac-sun7i-diff-wip (which is incomplete)

-look into suspend/resume
 -fails due to mmc card resuming (power on) too late causing rootfs errors

-look into using
 https://github.com/ssvb/xf86-video-sunxifb/commits/master

 https://github.com/amery/linux-sunxi/commit/e94c07323b3667130eedf1f833c12ccb80fd820d
 Need to fix in gpio-sunxi.c as well

-take photos of devices + create wiki pages so people can easily identify
 which device they have

-mali clock div is too low in many fex files when not using PLL6 for PLL4
